# tarot
This is an EXTREMELY simple application.
Meant to do little more but allow someone to say what tarot cards are in what position and generate the meanings of the cards.
It needs more layouts programmed, and needs certain small things like a config.php so that database info isn't hardcoded into every file (though there aren't many files).
Because this app is so simple it is written using some really plain jane HTML.
Additionally I DO NOT have the SQL file to create the database included. (though I will in the near future)
If you would like the HTML just shoot me an email at danny@dewdevelopment and I'll send it over to you.
Further if you have any questions feel free to send an email as well.
